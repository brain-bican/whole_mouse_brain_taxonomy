annotation	cell_set_accession			text	primary	An identifier that can be used to consistently refer to the set of cells being annotated, even if the cell_label changes.
annotation	cell_label		empty	text		This denotes any free-text term which the author uses to annotate cells, i.e. the preferred cell label name used by the author. Abbreviations are exceptable in this field; refer to 'cell_fullname' for related details.  Certain key words have been reserved: - `'doublets'` is reserved for encoding cells defined as doublets based on some computational analysis - `'junk'` is reserved for encoding cells that failed sequencing for some reason, e.g. few genes detected, high fraction of mitochondrial reads - `'unknown'` is explicitly reserved for unknown or 'author does not know' - `'NA'` is incomplete, i.e. no cell annotation was provided
annotation	cell_fullname		empty	text		This MUST be the full-length name for the biological entity listed in `cell_label` by the author. (If the value in `cell_label` is the full-length term, this field will contain the same value.)  NOTE: any reserved word used in the field 'cell_label' MUST match the value of this field.   EXAMPLE 1: Given the matching terms 'LC' and 'luminal cell' used to annotate the same cell(s), then users could use either terms as values in the field 'cell_label'. However, the abbreviation 'LC' CANNOT be provided in the field 'cell_fullname'.   EXAMPLE 2: Either the abbreviation 'AC' or the full-length term intended by the author 'GABAergic amacrine cell' MAY be placed in the field 'cell_label', but as full-length term naming this biological entity, 'GABAergic amacrine cell' MUST be placed in the field 'cell_fullname'.
annotation	parent_cell_set_accession		empty	text		A list of accessions of cell sets that subsume this cell set. This can be used to compose hierarchies of annotated cell sets, built from a fixed set of clusters.
annotation	parent_cell_set_name		empty	text		
annotation	labelset		empty	text	from(labelset.name)	The unique name of the set of cell annotations.  Each cell within the AnnData/Seurat file MUST be associated with a 'cell_label' value in order for this to be a valid 'cellannotation_setname'.
annotation	cell_ontology_term_id		empty	autocomplete_cl		This MUST be a term from either the Cell Ontology (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/ontologies/cl) or from some ontology that extends it by classifying cell types under terms from the Cell Ontology e.g. the Provisional Cell Ontology (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/ontologies/pcl) or the Drosophila Anatomy Ontology (DAO) (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols4/ontologies/fbbt).  NOTE: The closest available ontology term matching the value within the field 'cell_label' (at the time of publication) MUST be used. For example, if the value of 'cell_label' is 'relay interneuron', but this entity does not yet exist in the ontology, users must choose the closest available term in the CL ontology. In this case, it's the broader term 'interneuron' i.e.  https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/ontologies/cl/terms?obo_id=CL:0000099.
annotation	cell_ontology_term		empty	ontology_label		This MUST be the human-readable name assigned to the value of 'cell_ontology_term_id'
annotation	rationale		empty	text		The free-text rationale which users provide as justification/evidence for their cell annotations.  Researchers are encouraged to use this field to cite relevant publications in-line using standard academic citations of the form `(Zheng et al., 2020)` This human-readable free-text MUST be encoded as a single string. All references cited SHOULD be listed using DOIs under rationale_dois. There MUST be a 2000-character limit.
annotation	rationale_dois		empty	text		A list of valid publication DOIs cited by the author to support or provide justification/evidence/context for 'cell_label'. Multiple values can be concatenated by using the '|' character as a delimiter.
annotation	marker_gene_evidence		empty	text		List of names of genes whose expression in the cells being annotated is explicitly used as evidence for this cell annotation. Each gene MUST be included in the matrix of the AnnData/Seurat file. Multiple values can be concatenated by using the '|' character as a delimiter.
annotation	synonyms		empty	text		This field denotes any free-text term of a biological entity which the author associates as synonymous with the biological entity listed in the field 'cell_label'. In the case whereby no synonyms exist, the authors MAY leave this as blank, which is encoded as 'NA'. However, this field is NOT OPTIONAL. Multiple values can be concatenated by using the '|' character as a delimiter.

labelset	automated_annotation_reference_location		empty	text		This field denotes a valid URL of the annotated dataset that was the source of annotated reference data.  This MUST be a string of a valid URL. The concept of a 'reference' specifically refers to 'annotation transfer' algorithms, whereby a 'reference' dataset is used to transfer cell annotations to the 'query' dataset.
